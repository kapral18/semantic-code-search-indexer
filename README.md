# Semantic Code Search Indexer

This project is a high-performance code indexer designed to provide deep, contextual code intelligence for large codebases. It combines semantic search with rich metadata extraction to power advanced AI-driven development tools. The primary use case is to run on a schedule (e.g., a cron job) to keep an Elasticsearch index up-to-date with a git repository.

## Features

-   **High-Throughput Indexing**: Utilizes a multi-threaded, streaming architecture to efficiently parse and index thousands of files in parallel.
-   **Semantic Search**: Uses Elasticsearch's ELSER model to generate vector embeddings for code chunks, enabling powerful natural language search.
-   **Incremental Updates**: Can efficiently update the index by only processing files that have changed since the last indexed commit.
-   **Structured Logging**: Outputs logs in JSON format, making it easy to monitor and integrate with log management systems.
-   **Efficient `.gitignore` Handling**: Correctly applies `.gitignore` rules to exclude irrelevant files and directories.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v20 or later)
-   npm
-   An running Elasticsearch instance (v8.0 or later) with the **ELSER model downloaded and deployed**.

### 2. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd code-indexer
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file and update it with your Elasticsearch credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Compile the Code

The multi-threaded worker requires the project to be compiled to JavaScript.

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Commands

### `npm run setup`

Clones a target repository into the `./.repos/` directory to prepare it for indexing.

**Arguments:**
- `<repo_url>`: The URL of the git repository to clone.

**Example:**
```bash
npm run setup -- https://github.com/elastic/kibana.git
```

### `npm run index`

Performs a full index of a codebase. This command scans a directory and populates the Elasticsearch index from scratch. It is recommended to run this with a high memory limit.

**Arguments:**
- `<directory>`: The path to the codebase to index.
- `--clean`: (Optional) Deletes the existing index before starting.

**Example:**
```bash
# Index the Kibana repo located in the .repos directory
npm run index -- .repos/kibana --clean
```

### `npm run incremental-index`

After an initial full index, use this command to efficiently update the index. It pulls the latest changes from the repository, processes only the files that have changed since the last run, and updates the Elasticsearch index.

**Arguments:**
- `<directory>`: The path to the codebase to index.

**Example:**
```bash
npm run incremental-index -- .repos/kibana
```

## MCP Server Integration

This indexer is designed to work with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which exposes the indexed data through a standardized set of tools for AI coding agents. The official MCP server for this project is located in a separate repository.

For information on how to set up and run the server, please visit:
[https://github.com/elastic/semantic-code-search-mcp-server](https://github.com/elastic/semantic-code-search-mcp-server)

---

## Deployment

This indexer is designed to be deployed on a server (e.g., a GCP Compute Engine VM) and run on a schedule. For detailed instructions on how to set up the indexer with `systemd` timers or `cron`, please see the [GCP Deployment Guide](./docs/gcp_deployment_guide.md).

## Configuration

Configuration is managed via environment variables in a `.env` file.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` | The Cloud ID for your Elastic Cloud instance. | |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` | An API key for Elasticsearch authentication. | |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX` | The name of the Elasticsearch index to use. | `code-chunks` |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | The number of chunks to index in a single bulk request. | `500` |
| `CPU_CORES` | The number of CPU cores to use for file parsing. | Half of the available cores |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | The format of the logs. Can be `json` or `text`. | `json` |
| `SEMANTIC_CODE_INDEXER_LANGUAGES` | A comma-separated list of languages to index. | `typescript,javascript,markdown,yaml,java,go,python` |
