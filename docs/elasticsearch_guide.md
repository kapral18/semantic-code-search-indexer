# Elasticsearch Integration Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for connecting to, understanding, and utilizing the Elasticsearch index created by the `code-indexer` tool. It is intended for developers building a complimentary MCP server that will interact with the indexed code data.

## Connecting to Elasticsearch

The `code-indexer` tool uses the official Elasticsearch Node.js client. Connection is configured through the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT` | The HTTP endpoint of your Elasticsearch cluster. |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` | The Cloud ID for an Elastic Cloud deployment. |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` | The username for authentication. |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` | The password for authentication. |
| `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` | An API key for authentication. |

You can use either `ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT` for a self-hosted cluster or `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` for an Elastic Cloud deployment. You can authenticate with either a username/password combination or an API key.

### Example Connection (Node.js)

```javascript
const { Client } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch');

const client = new Client({
  cloud: {
    id: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID,
  },
  auth: {
    username: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD,
  },
  // Or, for API key authentication:
  // auth: {
  //   apiKey: process.env.ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY,
  // }
});
```

## Index Schema

The `code-indexer` creates multiple Elasticsearch indices, derived from the base index name you pass via the CLI (`repo[:index]`):

- `<index>` (e.g. `code-chunks`): primary chunk index (semantic search + metadata)
- `<index>_settings` (e.g. `code-chunks_settings`): small settings/state index (e.g. last indexed commit per branch)
- `<index>_locations` (e.g. `code-chunks_locations`): dedicated per-file location index (one document per chunk occurrence)

### Index Mapping

Here is the mapping for the primary `<index>` (e.g. `code-chunks`):

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "type": { "type": "keyword" },
      "language": { "type": "keyword" },
      "kind": { "type": "keyword" },
      "imports": {
        "type": "nested",
        "properties": {
          "path": { "type": "keyword" },
          "type": { "type": "keyword" },
          "symbols": { "type": "keyword" }
        }
      },
      "symbols": {
        "type": "nested",
        "properties": {
          "name": { "type": "keyword" },
          "kind": { "type": "keyword" },
          "line": { "type": "integer" }
        }
      },
      "exports": {
        "type": "nested",
        "properties": {
          "name": { "type": "keyword" },
          "type": { "type": "keyword" },
          "target": { "type": "keyword" }
        }
      },
      "containerPath": { "type": "text" },
      "chunk_hash": { "type": "keyword" },
      "content": { "type": "text" },
      "semantic_text": { "type": "semantic_text" },
      "created_at": { "type": "date" },
      "updated_at": { "type": "date" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | `keyword` | The type of the code chunk (e.g., 'class', 'function'). |
| `language` | `keyword` | The programming language of the code. |
| `kind` | `keyword` | The specific kind of the code symbol (from LSP). |
| `imports` | `nested` | Import metadata (path, type, imported symbols). |
| `symbols` | `nested` | Extracted symbol metadata (name, kind, line). |
| `exports` | `nested` | Export metadata (named/default/namespace). |
| `containerPath` | `text` | The path of the containing symbol (e.g., class name for a method). |
| `chunk_hash` | `keyword` | A hash of the content of the code chunk. |
| `content` | `text` | The raw source code of the chunk. |
| `semantic_text` | `semantic_text` | Semantic search field populated via Elasticsearch inference at ingest time. Note: it does **not** include file paths/directories; those live in `<index>_locations`. |
| `created_at` | `date` | The timestamp when the document was created. |
| `updated_at` | `date` | The timestamp when the document was last updated. |

### Locations index (`<index>_locations`)

To avoid “mega-documents” for boilerplate chunks (license headers, common imports, etc.), the indexer writes **one document per chunk occurrence** into `<index>_locations`.

- `chunk_id` is the **`_id` of the chunk document** in the primary index (stable sha256 identity).
- This store is the single source of truth for file paths, line ranges, directory fields, and git metadata.

Example mapping (high-level):

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "chunk_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "filePath": { "type": "wildcard" },
      "startLine": { "type": "integer" },
      "endLine": { "type": "integer" },
      "directoryPath": { "type": "keyword", "eager_global_ordinals": true },
      "directoryName": { "type": "keyword" },
      "directoryDepth": { "type": "integer" },
      "git_file_hash": { "type": "keyword" },
      "git_branch": { "type": "keyword" },
      "updated_at": { "type": "date" }
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Use the Index

The primary intended use of this index is semantic search over the codebase. The index uses Elasticsearch’s `semantic_text` field type to perform ELSER-backed semantic queries.

### Semantic Search

To perform a semantic search, use a `semantic` query against the `semantic_text` field.

#### Example Search Query (Node.js)

```javascript
async function searchCode(query) {
  const response = await client.search({
    index: '<index>',
    query: {
      semantic: {
        field: 'semantic_text',
        query,
      }
    },
  });

  return response.hits.hits.map((hit) => ({
    ...hit._source,
    score: hit._score,
  }));
}
```

### Other Queries

While the primary focus is on semantic search, you can also perform traditional Elasticsearch queries on the other fields. For example, you can filter chunk docs by `language` or `kind`.

For file-path filtering, query `<index>_locations` by `filePath` and join back to chunk docs using `chunk_id` (via `mget`).

### Joining chunk docs to file locations (important)

The indexer stores content-deduplicated chunk documents in `<index>` and per-file occurrences in `<index>_locations`:

- Query `<index>_locations` to find relevant occurrences (by `filePath`, directory fields, etc.).
- Use the resulting `chunk_id` values to fetch chunk documents from `<index>` (`mget`).

### Important Considerations

*   **ELSER Model / inference:** The `semantic_text` field is configured with an `inference_id`. Configure this via `SCS_IDXR_ELASTICSEARCH_INFERENCE_ID`.
*   **Index Name:** Always pass an explicit index name via the CLI (`repo[:index]`) and use that same base index name when querying (and when configuring any MCP server).
*   **Data Freshness:** The index is updated by running the `code-indexer` tool. For the MCP server to have the latest data, the index needs to be kept up-to-date by running the indexer regularly.

#### Choosing an inference endpoint (`SCS_IDXR_ELASTICSEARCH_INFERENCE_ID`): EIS vs ML nodes

`semantic_text` relies on an inference endpoint (`inference_id`) at ingest time. In practice, you’ll usually pick between these defaults:

- **`.elser-2-elasticsearch` (ML nodes)**: inference runs on your Elasticsearch deployment’s ML nodes. This is typically the best default for local/dev and for deployments where you manage ML capacity yourself.
- **`.elser-2-elastic` (EIS)**: inference runs on the Elastic Inference Service (managed). This does **not** consume your cluster’s ML resources and is generally the easiest way to get higher ingest throughput, but it may not be available for every deployment type and is subject to service rate limits.

If you’re unsure which endpoints your cluster has, list them with `GET /_inference` and pick an `inference_id` that exists on your deployment.

This repo does **not** select a default inference endpoint. If `semantic_text` is enabled (default), you must set `SCS_IDXR_ELASTICSEARCH_INFERENCE_ID`.
